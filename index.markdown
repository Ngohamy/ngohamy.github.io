## Inflation-Adjusted Housing Price Trends


Between 2005 and recent years, housing prices across Copenhagen districts have shown varying real-term trends. This visualization tracks the year-on-year percentage change in square meter prices, corrected for inflation to reflect real purchasing power. The data includes only apartments sold through regular sales — excluding auctions, family transfers, or other non-standard transactions.

Different districts display distinct patterns over time — some experience sharp increases during certain periods, while others remain stable or even decline in real terms.

A widespread negative growth is observed around 2007–2009, reflecting the impact of the 2008 financial crisis. More recently, in 2022–2023, all districts show a downturn, followed by renewed growth.

Explore the interactive chart below by hovering over data points or muting specific districts using the legend to focus on individual trends.
